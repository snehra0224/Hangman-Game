# Hangman-Game
This is a hangman game for two players. One player enters the word to be played with, 
while the other player guesses the letters of the word.
This project was created for fun, and for practicing programming. Additionally, it 
was meant to be an experiment with using Stringbuilder objects.
The game has two classes. The Hangman class contains the code for the game, while the
Driver class runs the game.
